# CIFAR-10 Image Classification from Scratch

## Description
This project implements a simple fully-connected neural network using only NumPy to classify images from 3 classes (airplane, cat, truck) from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes:
- Manual implementation of forward and backpropagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Loss curve visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (only for dataset loading)

## Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CIFAR10_Image_Classification.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells to train the model and evaluate it.
3. Review the loss curves and metrics.

# in folder CF_2Layer we use double hidden layer 
we use double hidden layer for decrese loss and increse accuracy but it not well work
