# Real-time Object Detection Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system using webcam input. The goal is to detect and classify common objects using a pre-trained deep learning model while maintaining a performance of over 15 FPS (frames per second).

---

##  Features
-  Utilizes pre-trained object detection models (e.g., YOLO, SSD).
-  Captures real-time video stream from the webcam.
-  Displays bounding boxes with confidence scores.
-  Detects at least 10 different object classes.
-  Optimized for real-time performance (>15 FPS).

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on model)
- Pre-trained models: YOLOv5 / SSD MobileNet / others
- NumPy
